## Installing the Flow React Component Library

The Flow React Component Library can be installed using a package manager like
`npm` or `yarn`.

```shell
yarn add @mittwald/flow-next-components
```

All components are available in this one package for ease of dependency
management.

## Import styles

You have to import the bundled stylesheet in order to get the correct component
styles. Add this line to your project's entry point.

```
import "@mittwald/flow-next-components/styles";
```
