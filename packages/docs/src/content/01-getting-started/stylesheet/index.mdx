The Flow Component libraries are styled by a shared stylesheet, that can also be
used standalone. This might be useful if you want to use your own framework to
build components following the mittwald styling guidelines.

On this page you can find information about how to install the stylesheet and
how the classnames are structured.

## Install the standalone stylesheet

At this point of development you can only get the stylesheet via NPM. The Flow
Stylesheet Library can be installed using a package manager like `npm` or
`yarn`.

```
yarn add @mittwald/flow-stylesheet
```

## Import styles

You have to import the bundled stylesheet in order to get the correct component
styles. Add this line to your project's entry point.

```
import "@mittwald/flow-stylesheet/css";
```

## Using the stylesheet

If you want to get started, you should probably learn how the class names are
structured. The class names provided in this stylesheet are following a
consistent, component-based and easy to understand schema.

### General class name notation

The class names are all in lowercase and using `-` to separate words and `--` to
separate logical sections.

The first logical section is always the `flow` namespace. Other sections might
be:

#### Components

```
.flow--button
.flow--heading
.flow--status-icon
```

#### Sub-Components

```
.flow--navigation
.flow--navigation--navigation-item
```

#### Specialization: different variants

```
.flow--button--primary
.flow--inline-alert--danger
.flow--icon--fixed-width
```

#### Specialization: components aligned in a composition

```
.flow--button--icon
.flow--inline-alert--status-icon
```

### A note to specialization

Class Names used to specialize a basic component must always be used in
**addition to the basic class name**. Here are some examples that illustrate
this requirement.

#### Combined variants

<LiveCodeEditor example="multiple-variants" />

#### Components aligned in a composition

It is a common practice to compose larger components out of already existing
smaller ones. Take the Inline Alert example. The Inline Alert is composed out of
an icon, a heading and some optional content. These contained components must
have their basic class name (`flow--icon`), to get their basic styling and the
specialization class name (`flow--inline-alert--status-icon`) to get the Inline
Alert specific styles.
